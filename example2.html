  <p>The established best practice for all websites now, <strong>responsive design</strong> has become the solution to a problem that was once considered the web designer&rsquo;s nightmare. <br>
  With the explosion of mobile technology, gone are the days of designing websites for desktop monitors alone; now we have to deal with smartphones and tablet devices. </p>
  <p>Businesses don&rsquo;t want to miss out on those valuable visitors, and so we&rsquo;re tasked to design web experiences for them, too. Before responsive design, accommodating the growing number of mobile devices meant that web designers were designing multiple versions of the same site for different screen sizes: <em>obviously not an ideal solution</em>. Responsive design is an attempt to create a single site design that can adapt its content to look great on all devices. </p>
  <h3>Example Website</h3>
  <p>Here is an example of a responsive website. The site responds to different screen sizes, but the content is still viewable, and the design still looks <strong>consistent</strong> and <strong>beautiful</strong> on all three.</p>
